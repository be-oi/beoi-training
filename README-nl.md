# beOI/beCP Training Resources
This repository hosts all the course materials created for the [beOI](http://beoi.be-oi.be/) (Belgian Olympiad in Informatics) and [beCP](http://becp.be-oi.be/) (Belgian Competitive Programming) training camps.

The program is now structured into a set of teaching units, designed to cover the whole IOI syllabus (and a some additional material from the [CP3](http://cpbook.net/) book). Each unit contains the slides used and a README which outlines the content of the unit, lists the prerequisites and gives links to related exercises (when applicable).

The resources made prior to the units system are available in the [archive](archive) directory.

## Teaching units
Here is the list of completed and planned teaching units. As they are still under construction, the units might not contain all the topics mentioned in the parentheses.

1. [Algoritmes en Complexiteit](01-complexity/README-nl.md) (big oh, practical limits)
7. [Union Find Disjoint Sets](07-union-find/README-nl.md)
